# Bisaya-Interpreter

This is an ongoing project

Tutorial Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VB5TY1sIRo&list=PL_2VhOvlMk4UHGqYCLWc6GO8FaPl8fQTh

IMPORTANT!  
You must have Deno installed and you have to enable it via ".vscode/settings.json" file and set "deno.enable": true

From Ep 1 to 7 only. After that, I will try to create the interpreter for Bisaya++

EP 1 - DONE  
EP 2 - DONE  
EP 3 - DONE  
EP 4 - STARTING...
EP 5 - NOT DONE  
EP 6 - NOT DONE  
EP 7 - NOT DONE  

My thoughts: Do-able but it is very tricky and will consume most of your brain power.
