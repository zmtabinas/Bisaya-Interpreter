IMPORTANT!  
You must have Deno installed and you have to enable  
it via ".vscode/settings.json" file and set "deno.enable": true

From Ep 1 to 7 only. After that, I will try to create the interpreter for Bisaya++

EP 1 - DONE ✅  
EP 2 - DONE ✅  
EP 3 - DONE ✅  
EP 4 - STARTING... 😍  
EP 5 - NOT DONE 💔   
EP 6 - NOT DONE 💔  
EP 7 - NOT DONE 💔  

My thoughts: Do-able but it is very tricky and  
will consume most of your brain power. 🧠
